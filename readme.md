## Overview

This project implements a Pose Estimation system using OpenCV and MediaPipe, encapsulated within a Flask web application. It allows users to upload images and receive real-time feedback on whether clapping is detected.


## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to provide a practical example of integrating machine learning models with a web framework. It aims to serve as an instructional tool for younger students in the software engineering field, demonstrating the use of computer vision and web development.

## Features

- Upload images through a user-friendly web interface.
- Detect Poses in the uploaded images using MediaPipe.
- Provide immediate feedback on the detection results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- HTML/CSS
